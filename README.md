Welcome to the **Frost Business Directory**, a sleek and modern web application designed to help users discover local businesses with ease. Built for a hackathon, this project combines a frosty glass UI aesthetic, voice search functionality, and a seamless dark mode experience to create an intuitive and visually stunning directory.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Frost Business Directory is a React-based web app that allows users to search, filter, and explore local businesses. Whether you're looking for a cozy caf√© or a reliable plumber, our directory provides a user-friendly interface to find businesses by name, category, or location. With features like voice search, dark mode, and a frosty glass design, we aim to deliver a delightful user experience that‚Äôs both functional and visually appealing.

This project was built to showcase innovation in UI/UX design, accessibility, and modern web development practices, making it a standout entry for hackathons.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Frosty Glass UI**: A visually stunning frosted glass effect using Tailwind CSS, giving the app a wintery, elegant vibe.
- **Voice Search**: Hands-free searching with speech recognition (available on supported browsers).
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for a comfortable viewing experience in any lighting condition.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter businesses by category (e.g., Restaurants, Services) for quick discovery.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Business Profiles**: Detailed profiles for each business, including services, hours, contact info, and a gallery slider.
- **Review System**: Users can leave ratings and reviews for businesses, with sentiment visualization (coming soon).
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and hover effects powered by Framer Motion for an engaging experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js for building reusable components and managing state.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and frosty glass effects.
- **Routing**: React Router for seamless navigation between pages.
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth and interactive animations.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on GitHub Pages for free, accessible hosting.
- **Voice Recognition**: Web Speech API for voice search functionality.
- **Slider**: React Slick for the business gallery carousel.
